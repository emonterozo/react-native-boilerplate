# React Native Boilerplate

Welcome to the React Native Boilerplate! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

This project script sets up a robust and efficient starting point for your React Native projects. With pre-configured ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged setups, you can focus more on coding and less on configuration.

## Features

- **ESLint & Prettier:** Maintain code quality and consistency with ESLint and Prettier configurations.
- **Husky & lint-staged:** Enforce code quality checks before commits with Husky and lint-staged.
- **Alias Path Importing:** Simplify import statements with configured alias paths.
- **@react-navigation:** Integrated navigation setup with @react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/stack.
- **Gesture Handling:** Smooth gesture handling with react-native-gesture-handler.
- **TypeScript Support:** Enjoy type safety and better code organization with TypeScript.
- **React Native Testing Library:** Simplify testing with React Native Testing Library for effective and reliable UI testing.

## Testing Locally

To test this React Native Boilerplate locally, follow these steps:

1. **Run npm link:** This command makes the script available locally, allowing you to use it as a command-line tool.

    ```bash
    npm link
    ```

2. **Create a new project:** Now, you can use the boilerplate script (`react-native-boilerplate`) followed by the desired project name to create a new React Native project.

    ```bash

    ```

    Replace `ProjectName` with the name of your project.
